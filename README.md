### Throughout this journey, I've learned so much about building dynamic web applications using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS templating. In addition to following Piyush Garg's tutorials, I took the opportunity to enhance the project by adding two exciting features:

1. <b> Profile Page for Users </b> <br> I implemented a user profile page where users can view their personal information, including their name, email, role, and the date they joined the platform. This feature adds a personalized touch to the application and enhances the user experience.

2. <b> Delete Blog Option from User Profile </b> <br> Building on the existing functionality, I introduced the ability for users to delete their own blog posts directly from their profile page (using a client-side API call). This feature empowers users to manage their content and gives them greater control over their contributions to the platform.
